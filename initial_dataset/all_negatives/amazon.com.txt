Not good at all! 
Product not right and nobody fixing the problem.
Don't buy the iPhone unless you want to be scammed.
I smell a SCAM.
Do yourself a favor and avoid the iPhone, unless you want to just keep handing over your money to Apple.
I hate to have to buy a new one already.
OK, I'm finally done with these people.
BHG, I am SO done with you!
I'm tired of wading through all of the ads trying to find the magazine.
I'm cancelling my subscription in favor of magazines with less advertising and better layout.
A huge waste.
Very disappointed.
